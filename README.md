# Synthia (Basic)

This is the audio engine of Synthia, which I originally built in the summer of 2023 using only vanilla JavaScript and the WebAudio API. 

Though Synthia has grown to use React for the front end and Flask/PostgreSQL to manage users and save synth patches on the back end, here I've pared the project down to its simpler beginnings for submission as part of my application to the Recurse Center.
